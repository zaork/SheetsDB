## Developing

There is still plenty to work on before this becomes a robust tool. I have been using this for my own work, but it seems like it could be useful to someone else, so I decided to release the code I have developed so far.

Because this tool is still in development, it has not been released publicly to the Chrome Web Store. If you want to see/install it, go to [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sheet-to-data/mhmjmmomcaimcoefbhdggmijkjpblhgf].
